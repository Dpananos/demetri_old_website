I'm a Senior Data Scientist at Zapier. I am also a part time Ph.D candidate in Biostatistics at Western University.  My research interests surround machine learning and Bayesian statistics for personalized medicine.  In 2019, I contributed differential equation functionality to PyMC3, a python library for doing Bayesian inference.  For my contribution, I was awarded [NUMFOCUS' New Contributor Award](https://numfocus.org/blog/2019-numfocus-awards).

I earned my Masters of Mathematics in Applied Mathematics from The University of Waterloo. My thesis concerned vaccine hesitancy and early warning signals of impending outbreaks of measles, using the 2014 Disneyland measles outbreak as a case study.  I published my findings in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/52/13762).
